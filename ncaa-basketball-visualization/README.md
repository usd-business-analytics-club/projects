# NCAA Basketball Game Data Visualization Project

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Your task is to create an interactive data visualization dashboard using a clean NCAA basketball game dataset. The goal is to identify and communicate patterns or insights related to team performance, fouls, scoring dynamics, and officiating.  
You will deploy your dashboard using either **Streamlit (Python)** or **RShiny (R)**.

## âœ… Project Requirements

### 1. Data Exploration
- Load the dataset and inspect its structure.  
- Consider derived variables where helpful (e.g., foul differentials, scoring margins, game month).  
- No in-depth cleaning is necessary, but you should understand what each column represents.  

---

### 2. Visualizations  
Create at least **three meaningful visualizations**. You may choose from the following categories or propose your own:

#### â€¢ Foul Trends  
Show trends in fouls over time, by team, or by half.

#### â€¢ Home vs. Away Analysis  
Compare team performance based on home vs. away games, particularly fouls and scoring.

#### â€¢ Official Impact  
Explore whether certain referees are associated with more fouls or free throws.

#### â€¢ Scoring Dynamics  
Analyze score changes from first half to second half or final results.

#### â€¢ Free Throw Performance  
Visualize correlations between free throw metrics (FTA, FTM, FT%) and game outcomes.

### 3. Challenge: Interactivity & Dashboard Design  
> _You will learn a great deal._

I learned a great deal from this resource:  
[Google Sheets Example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LPe8xYduoep9qCrNzBGdJHaHZ8dnmdHNnu7UXZKzawU/edit?gid=627465558#gid=627465558)

- Create an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit** or **RShiny**.  
- Include user controls (such as dropdowns, date pickers, or sliders) to filter the data by:
  - Team  
  - Date range  
  - Venue  
  - Officials  
- Make the layout clear and intuitive.

---

### 4. Deployment
- Deploy your dashboard publicly via **Streamlit Cloud** or **ShinyApps.io**.  
- Ensure the app is accessible via a shareable URL.
