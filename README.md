Each folder inside the [`projects/`](https://github.com/usd-business-analytics-club/projects/tree/main/projects) directory contains a dedicated analytics project, complete with an individual `README.md` file outlining:

- 📌 Project description and objectives  
- 📁 Dataset details or download links  
- 🚀 Starter instructions or code (if available)

Projects are a mix of:
- ✍️ Curated assignments by club members or USD faculty  
- 🌐 Real-world case studies and take-home projects used in analytics hiring processes  
- 🔍 Publicly sourced problem statements for hands-on skill development  

We will continue updating this directory with new datasets and challenges from across domains like sports, marketing, logistics, finance, and more.
